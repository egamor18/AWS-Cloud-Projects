# AWS Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of **AWS projects**, **hands-on exercises**, and **documentation** for testing various AWS services.

To make learning structured and progressive, the projects are organized into three levels:

- **Beginner** – Foundational projects to get started with core AWS services.  
- **Intermediate** – Practical use cases that combine multiple services.  
- **Advanced** – Complex, real-world scenarios and deployment architectures.
